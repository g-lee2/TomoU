Name of Student: Grace
Name of Project: TomoU
Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?) Create a space where Japanese language learners can meet people and share resources with each other.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
-User registration and login: Allow users to create an account and log in to your app, enabling them to access the language exchange features and view their profile information. (Sign-up through socials only?)
-User profiles: Enable users to create and edit their profiles, including information such as their name, profile picture, language level, and language exchange interests.
-Flashcard screen: Users can create flashcards for vocabulary words they encounter while reading books in their target language. Users can add definitions, example sentences, and other information to the flashcards.
They can choose to share their flashcard list with other users in the app. Users can send requests to view other users' flashcard lists and make comments or suggestions.
-Friend finding screen: Users can search for other language learners based on their language schools or study abroad universities. Users can filter search results by school name, location, and other criteria.
-Messaging and chat: Enable users to communicate with their language exchange partners through a messaging or chat feature within the app, allowing them to practice their language skills and make progress in their language learning. The chat feature should allow users to send text messages, and possibly audio or video messages as well.
-Language exchange challenges: Users can create language exchange challenges that encourage users to practice their language skills in creative ways, such as by writing short stories or creating videos in the language they are learning.
-Language exchange events: Users can create a calendar of language exchange events, such as language exchange meetups, language exchange dinners, or language exchange workshops. Users could RSVP to attend events and connect with other language learners in person.

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

-I want to work on the splash screen and include a 3d animation of the logo.
-I want to work on making the application function on android devices(fix code where components are IOS exclusive).

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
-React Three Fiber/Three.js or React Native Reanimated or Lottie
-Typescript
